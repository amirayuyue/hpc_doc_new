  "description": "Some researchers may have needs that exceed our campus computing capabilities. They may need more machines to complete a task quickly or they may need more specialized types of computing nodes (e.g. GPU nodes). We have access to both the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and the national-level computing resources known as XSEDE now ACCESS. SDSC and ACCESS offer significant amounts of compute time to researchers interested in trying HPC at large-scales.",
